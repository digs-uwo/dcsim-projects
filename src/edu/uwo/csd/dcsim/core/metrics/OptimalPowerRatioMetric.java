		 * 
		 * We then sort all Hosts in the data centre by power efficiency, starting with the most efficient host. We remove 
		 * the number of CPU shares that the most efficient host possesses from cpuRemaining, and add the power that the host
		 * would consume given 100% load to the optimal power consumption. We then move on to the next most efficient host
		 * until cpuRemaining = 0 (all cpu has been assigned to a host).
		 * 
		 * The final host will probably not be entirely filled by the cpuRemaining still left to assign. If this is the case,
		 * we calculate what the CPU utilization of the host would be given that all of cpuRemaining is placed on the host, and use
		 * this value to calculate the host's power consumption. This power consumption is then added to the optimal power consumption.
